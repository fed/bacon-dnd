In this example we are building a Kanban board with some cards and we wanna basically add some functionality so we can click on these cards, drag them around and when we let them go they will snap back to their original position or into a new column.

> Disclaimer: This example is based on [Blake Haswell](http://blakehaswell.com/)'s talk on Functional Reactive Programming at SydJS back in March 2016.
